# 🧠 NeuroKit

**NeuroKit** is a futuristic SaaS platform that enables developers and teams to build, personalise, and scale **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)**—modular configurations that govern how LLMs behave in specific tasks, applications, and domains. ;lm;l

Whether you're a solo dev fine-tuning a chat agent or a company deploying context-specific copilots at scale, NeuroKit empowers you with the tools to create, share, and reuse LLM behaviours—securely and efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features (In Progress & Planned)

- 🧩 **MCP Marketplace** – Buy, sell, or open-source modular context setups  
- 🛠️ **Built-in Codespace** – Tweak and test MCPs directly in-browser  
- 🔐 **Secure Sharing** – Granular permission layers for teams and collaborators  
- 📁 **Dataset Uploads** – Attach data that governs model responses  
- 🔌 **API Integrations** – Plug into your workflows or model APIs  
- 🏷️ **Tagging & Discoverability** – Find relevant MCPs with smart categorisation

## 👤 My Role

Built from scratch as a solo project – from product vision, UX, design, to frontend implementation. Currently working on extending backend infrastructure and behaviour rendering pipeline.

## 🧠 What are MCPs?

**Model Context Protocols** are modular configurations that structure and guide the behaviour of LLMs. Think of them as blueprints or personality layers that can be plugged into models like GPT to fine-tune how they respond to specific tasks, tones, or workflows.
