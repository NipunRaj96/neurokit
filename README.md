# Neurokit

> **Shape how AI thinks.**

**Neurokit** is a GitHub-like marketplace for Model Control Panels (MCPs) tailored for Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables developers to upload, share, or sell MCPs that control the behaviour, tone, and capabilities of LLMs—whether you're building AI assistants, tutors, or custom chatbots.

## 🧭 What is an MCP?

### Imagine a child as an LLM

Just like a child can talk, answer questions, draw, or write poems, an LLM can perform many tasks. But to make the child behave a certain way, the parent gives instructions.

### 👨‍👧 The Parent = MCP

A **Model Control Panel (MCP)** is like a set of rules, instructions, and behaviours that guide the LLM. Think:

- “Only talk about maths.”
- “Use British English.”
- “Be concise and polite.”

These instructions shape how the LLM responds. An MCP controls tone, style, scope, and more—making LLMs behave exactly how you want.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **MCP Marketplace** – Upload, explore, and fork public or private MCPs.
- **Dataset Attachments** – Upload datasets for context or fine-tuning (externally handled).
- **Secure Transactions** – Monetise your MCPs with simple, clean pricing.
- **API Integration** – Seamlessly connect and deploy MCPs into your own workflows or applications.
- **User Recommendations** – AI-assisted suggestions for relevant MCPs based on needs.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Build AI tutors with a friendly tone.
- Create domain-restricted assistants (legal, medical, academic).
- Generate agents with clear formatting styles or personality traits.
- Control behaviour without hosting your own model.

## 🧪 Future Considerations

- **In-Browser Fine-Tuning (External Support)** – Trigger and preview tuning results using third-party endpoints.
- **Custom Model Uploads** – Allow users to bring their own LLMs and apply MCPs.
- **Private MCP Collaboration** – Teams working together on restricted access panels.
- **Analytics & Usage Insights** – View how often an MCP is used, liked, or integrated.
- **Prompt Templates** – Save and reuse multi-layered instructions or chains.
- **Multi-Model Support** – Apply MCPs across GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

---

## 🛠 Roadmap

- Version control for MCPs (fork, commit, merge)
- Public vs private panel visibility
- Community rating system
- Plug-and-play with frontend agents
